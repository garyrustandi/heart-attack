# Classification with R: Heart Attack Prediction

Check out this link to the ![project](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/garyrustandi/heart-attack/blob/main/index.html)

Heart attack is one of the deadliest disease in the world. It would be great for patients, insurance companies, and doctors if we can predict the chance of getting heart attack.
The goal of this project is to predict whether someone will get heart disease or not based on the characteristics today.

This project consists of background, data exploration & cleaning, and classification modelling. The best model is achieved using random forest regressor:

The best model is able to achieve roc_auc score of 0.95

Chest pain and maximum heart rate achieved are the most important variables in determining the risk of heart attack.
